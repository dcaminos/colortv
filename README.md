# Color TV

This is a demo app to show coding style over React Native

For this project I used [Redux](https://redux.js.org/)  to manage app state and [React Navigation](https://reactnavigation.org/) to handle  screen and routes.


## Installation

```bash
yarn
pushd ios && pod install && popd
yarn react-native run-ios
yarn react-native run-android
```


## TODO
- Styles
- Tests
